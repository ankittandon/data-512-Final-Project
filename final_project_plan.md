# Final Project Plan

## Introduction
Each year when Fall begins, it's hard to not notice the ubiquitous encouragement to get a flu shot. Whether it is on social media, at work, on the radio, or at the grocery store there are signs everywhere telling us to get our vaccination done in the matter of minutes. As such, I am interested in studying  techniques that can be employed to increase population of individuals who receive a flu shot. 

To give more background, in the 2018-2019 season the CDC estimates that between 163 to 168 million doses of flu vaccine were distributed in the United States <sup>[1](#myfootnote1)</sup>. This accounts for big business and generates private Pharmaceutical firms billions of dollars in revenue each season. According to the World Health Organization, the influenza market is estimated to gross $3.8 billion in sales in 2018 with the the drug Fluzone (manufactured by Pharmaceutical company Sanofi Pasteur) topping the list of highest sold drugs. Fluzone generated $1.2 billion USD in sales in 2010 <sup>[2](#myfootnote2)</sup>. While the flu vaccine certainly generates considerable revenue for private pharma companies, the influenza disease has a huge impact on the US economy annually. Researchers from the CDC have estimated that "in 2003, the total economic burden of annual influenza epidemics using projected statistical life values amounted to $87.1 billion. The annual influenza epidemics result in 3.1 million hospitalized days, 31.4 million outpatient visits, and $10.4 billion in direct medical costs.<sup>[3](#myfootnote3)</sup>."

There is some discussion on the effectiveness and perhaps the need for the influenza vaccine. The CDC conducts annual vaccination effectiveness trials to judge the VE (vaccine effectiveness) percentage of the influenza vaccine. The results of these trials show that in the 2017-2018 season, the influenza vaccine has a VE% score of 40 <sup>[4](#myfootnote4)</sup>. This implies that the vaccination reduced the risk of flu illness in the population by 40%. On the other hand there are potential side effects to the vaccine such as headaches, fainting, muscle aches, and nausea as listed by the CDC <sup>[5](#myfootnote5)</sup>.That said, my goal of this project is not to discuss the effectiveness of the vaccination but to take it for granted and to focus my attention on methods that can be used to increase the utilization of the vaccine. 



In this final project I hope to understand what methods can be used to increase vaccination rates and not to discuss the effectiveness of the vaccination. However, through my research the effectiveness of vaccinations has come up and I want state some statistics and cite some sources that discuss 

While the effectiveness of the seasonal influenza vaccination varies from year to year based on the mutations in the strain
